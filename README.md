# Awesome RenPy [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome goodies for [RenPy](https://renpy.org/) visual novel engine. Originally this started as me dumping my bookmark folder, but since this accrued some interest, I decided to make this more of a thing. Things that were known to be obsolete at the time of writing -- which happens relatively often in the RenPy land -- did not make it into this list unless they were otherwise significant or were the only example of their kind.

Who am I kidding, this will languish in obscurity like every other attempt to produce an index of these things...

## Cookbook

Most useful RenPy code comes in the form of code snippets, examples, and other small pieces, rather than a well-packaged library. As such, many of these links link to Gists, forum posts, and other such locations wherein a given code snippet is presented in context. You can always wade the depths of [Lemmasoft RenPy forums](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewforum.php?f=51) yourself for more.
